<h1><em> Kevin</em></h1>
<h2> Backstory:</h2>
<h4> Kevin is the head chef of the cruise. He has been known to get very mad at customers who send back his terrible food. Kevin doesnt tolerate anything less then a 30 dollar tip for his food and has been known to extremely angry at those who dont do so. However he is very loyal to his job and loves too cook even though hes bad at it.                                                                                                                            </h4>
<h2> Suspicion:</h2>
<h4> Kevin and the victim apparently had argued over the quality of the food. Kevin made a number of threats to the victim and the victim quickly paid for his bill and left. Kevin was later seen sharpening his knife.</h4>
<h2> Statement:</h2>
<h4> Yes it is true that I have a history of getting mad at customers who dont respect me and my kitchen. I put work into my food only to be disrepected by the victim. So yes I did get very mad at yelled at him but that doesnt mean I wanted to kill the guy over it. I was sharpening the kitchen knife because im going to be quitting this job and beginning a career in knife sharpening, my dream as a boy.</h4>
