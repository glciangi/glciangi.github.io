<h1><em>Susan</em></h1>
<h2> Backstory:</h2>
<h4> Susan is Karens sister and the aunt to the victims children. Karen has been said to be a person who would do anything for her family. </h4>
<h2> Suspicion:</h2>
<h4> Karen and the victim were known for getting into arguments and everyone in the family was aware that they didnt get along. This cruise was supposed to be a break from all the fighting but as soon as they got on the boat they were already beginning to argue with eachother about what to do. Karen got so mad that she ran away from the argument and her family went to look for her with no success. The detectives were able to find her later in the kitchen talking to the head chef Kevin.</h4>
<h2> Statement:</h2>
<h4>Everyone who has knows me knows im a person who loves my family. I did get into frequent arguments with the victim but I still loved him and I would never do anthing to hurt my family. The victim meant a lot to my sister and I would never do that to her no matter what. I wanted to get some space from the victim because I didnt want to ruin the cruise for the rest of my family. I was trying to be the bigger person and its just a coincidence that the victim ended up dyingwhile I was away because I wish we could have ended on good terms. I was actually talking to the head chef because I wanted to get a special cake in honor of the cruise</h4>
