<h1><em>Karen</em></h1>
<h2> Backstory:</h2>
<h4> Karen went on this cruize with her husband, (the victim), sister, their two children, and the rest of her huge family to help get rid of the bad blood between her husband and her sister. Karen and her husband have just retired and have decided to enjoy their retirement on a beautiful cruise.  </h4>
<h2> Suspicion:</h2>
<h4>Karen wanted to go to Africa, but her husband said that would be to difficult with the kids. The kids agreed with their dad and Karen gave in to the idea of a cruise. One of their children claims he heard her mom say something about <em> Sleeping with the fishes.</em></h4>
<h2> Statement:</h2>
<h4> I couldnt have been the murderer because I loved my husband and I love my family too much. Yes I did say that we would be sleeping with the fishes tonight, but I was only reffering to the fact that we were on the bottom level of the boat... very close to the water. </h4>
